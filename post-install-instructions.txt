Complete your installation by performing these steps.
            
1. You should add the following command to your cron table. It should run
every minute:
---
php <installation path>/artisan schedule:run
---

2. Specify a Slack webhook url in the `notifications.slack.url` key
in configuration.php. You can create a webhook url on the slack
website: https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/

3. Add your first monitor by running:
---
php <installation path>/artisan monitor:create
---

The configuration file `configuration.php` can found inside the installation directory.
