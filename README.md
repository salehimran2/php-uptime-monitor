`uptime-monitor-app` is a powerful, easy to configure uptime monitor written in PHP 7. It will notify you when one of your sites goes down (and when it comes back up). You can also be notified a few days before an SSL certificate on one of your sites expires. Out of the box you can be notified via mail or Slack.

Here are some examples of how the Slack notifications look like:

Under the hood the uptime-monitor is a vanilla Laravel 5.3 application with the [laravel-uptime-monitor](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-uptime-monitor) installed into it. If you know your way around Laravel, it's recommended that you use [laravel-uptime-monitor](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-uptime-monitor) instead of this app.

## Installation

You can install the application by issuing this command:

```bash
composer create-project spatie/uptime-monitor-app <name of install directory>
```

To complete your installation these steps must be performed:
            
First you should add the following command to your cron table. It should run
every minute:

```bash
php <installation path>/artisan schedule:run
```

Secondly, specify a Slack webhook url in the `notifications.slack.url` key
in `configuration.php` found in the installation directory. You can [create a new webhook url](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/) on the Slack website.

## Configuration

The configuration file `configuration.php` is located inside the installation directory.

Reading it is a good way to quickly get a feel of what `uptime-monitor-app` can do. Here's the content of the config file:

```php
return [

    /*
     * You can get notified when specific events occur. Out of the box you can use 'mail'
     * and 'slack'. Of course you can also specify your own notification classes.
     */
    'notifications' => [

        'notifications' => [
            \Spatie\UptimeMonitor\Notifications\Notifications\UptimeCheckFailed::class => ['slack'],

    'monitor_model' => Spatie\UptimeMonitor\Models\Monitor::class,

```




## Basic usage

To start monitoring a url:

```php
php artisan monitor:create <url>
```

and answer the questions that are asked. If your url starts with `https://` the application will also monitor the ssl certificate.

To stop monitoring a url issue this command:

```php
php artisan monitor:delete <url>
```

To list all monitors you can perform:

```php
php artisan monitor:list
```

## Advanced usage

Under the hood the uptime-monitor is a vanilla Laravel 5.3 application with our [laravel-uptime-monitor](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-uptime-monitor) installed into it. Please refer to [it's extensive documentation](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-uptime-monitor) to know more how to configure and use this application. 

By default the application will use a `sqlite` database located at `<installation directory>/database.sqlite` to store all monitors.
